# MacOS

> *coming soon*

I'm not writing the full guide right now, but here's a list of instructions:

- Download the executable -- Go to Releases on the MCsniperGO GitHub and download the macos version you need
- Make it executable -- Open a terminal, `cd`, to the folder where the downloaded file is, and run `chmod +x ./filename`
- Run the sniper -- Using the same terminal run `./filename`. This will make accounts.txt and config.toml, refer to the [accounts](../acc
- ) section for filling in account.txt. You can probably ignore config.toml.
- Running the sniper again -- Open a terminal and cd to the directory where the file you originally downloaded is, and run `./filename`
