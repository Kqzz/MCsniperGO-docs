## READ. ALL. THE. TEXT.
it's not hard, read it all. it's all important.

## Downloading The Sniper

Open the [MCsniperGO GitHub page releases tab](https://github.com/Kqzz/MCsniperGO/releases) and
locate the latest release for Windows (most likely named `MCsniperGO_X.XX_windows_64-bit.exe`) and download it (click it to download). Next, Move the downloaded executable file to it's own folder. e.g. make a folder on your desktop and move the executable into the created folder. This is to fix a possible permissions error and for ease-of-use later on.

## Running The Sniper
Run the sniper by double clicking it. This will display an error saying "Windows protected your PC", just press "More info" and "Run anyway" to start the sniper. *If you don't trust MCsniperGO, then either read the source code to confirm it's safe or just don't use it.* Close the sniper after the first run.

Running the sniper for the first time will create `accounts.txt` and `config.toml`. You can ignore `config.toml` for now, but you do have to edit `accounts.txt` before you will be able to snipe. Refer to the [accounts](../accounts.md) section for information on the formatting of your accounts.

> Note for later: running multiple instances of the sniper for the same name will NOT increase your chances of getting a name.
